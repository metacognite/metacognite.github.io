When I finish reading something, I'm always curious **exactly** what I should read next. But, most writing does not accommodate.

Non-fiction books have footnotes, sometimes "read more" sections at the end. Footnotes are hard to reference back to while you're reading, and oftentimes there are so many of them. "Read more" sections are at the end of the book, which is too late. Ideal IMO >  "read more" sections at the end of every chapter, with ~3 suggestions.

Blogs / long-form writing online is similar. Posts scatter links throughout. It becomes troublesome to curate and decide what's most important that I should read next.

There are great counterexamples! I was reading [BaseDS](https://medium.com/baseds), a series of medium posts about distributed systems. Vaidehi Joshi (the author) adds a ["Resources"](https://medium.com/baseds/ordering-distributed-events-29c1dd9d1eff) section to the bottom of every post. "Resources" includes 5 links or fewer on what to read next. This tactic is effective, I know exactly what to read next, and it's a short/directed list.

(As an aside, Vaidehi is the best computer science writer I've ever come across. I wish I had Vaidehi's series on algorithms when I was in undergrad!)

Of course, this is often NA. Sometimes, there's nothing more to say, do, or learn. But when applicable, I'll avoid this! I will add a "next 3 things to read" section to posts where it makes sense. Let's see how it goes!
