This is my first post. I've never written consistent medium-form. I have a few intentions:
1. Think clearer
2. Talk through ideas with friends
3. Write better
4. Try something new

I'll be undirected for the most part, but expect to hear more about:
- no surprise > metacognition / mental models I'm learning about 
- things I'm building, likely software
- random management musings (day job > technical ppl manager)
- hypotheses on the future
- health & medicine >> survival

I won't spend much time on these posts. Likely 15 mins altogether (my default timebox on Be Focused Pro). Also, I may go back and edit posts.
