Examples are often the most useful starting point.

When I am making an important decision, I often default to deduction. There should be some logic or rigor that generates the right decision.

i.e. What kind of idea do I want to work on? --> Come up with a theory of what I care about, become rigorous about a few constraints, then work from there. 

But this can easily go wrong. I can come up with the wrong assumptions, or I can assign false levels of confidence to what I care about vs not.

Sometimes, it's best to operate like a supervised learning model. Look at several, or many, cases of a thing. Grade your reaction on each thing. Then extrapolate and use the model to determine what you care about. As an example: if you're looking for a new job > list out 100 companies, grade them as "yes", "maybe", "no" as fast as possible (so that you're honest) and observe what you care about. 

Maybe it's just me, but I've only appreciated this kind of inductive reasoning more over the last few years. And I notice most friends of mine default to deductive reasoning as well. But IMO sometimes modeling your intuition & extrapolating is the most effective thing to do! I prioritize induction and "training the model" for decisions much more these days.
