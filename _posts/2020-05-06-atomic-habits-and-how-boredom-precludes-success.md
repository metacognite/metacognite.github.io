How often do you get bored with difficult things?   
- working on another project
- debugging the n-th issue in your codebase
- finishing a task
- writing your latest PRD
- etc

Someone recommended ["Atomic Habits"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D23CFGR) a few days ago. So I finally read it this weekend.

I'm skeptical of "productivity" books. But this one is good, and this snippet resonated more than anything else in the book:

> “What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?” He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.” His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work ethic.

I always get bored with most things at some point. IMO boredom proxies fear:
- outcome won't be good enough
- I won't finish XYZ fast enough
- I will not succeed
