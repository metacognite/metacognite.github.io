I"b<p>This is my first post. I’ve never written consistent medium-form. I have a few intentions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Think clearer</li>
  <li>Talk through ideas with friends</li>
  <li>Write better</li>
  <li>Try something new</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll be undirected for the most part, but expect to hear more about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>metacognition ( / mental models I’m learning about</li>
  <li>things I’m building, likely software</li>
  <li>random management musings (day job &gt; technical ppl manager)</li>
  <li>hypotheses on the future</li>
  <li>health &amp; medicine (topics I care deeply about)s</li>
</ul>
